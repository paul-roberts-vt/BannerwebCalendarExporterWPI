# Bannerweb Calendar Exporter (MU)
Allows bannerweb users to export the detailed schedule to a file that can be added iCal or Google Calendar. 

Current work is focused on adapting it for use at Miami University (MU). 
<p>Can be edited to work for other schools, although it should work out of the box.</p>

Run from the Detailed Schedule page. Simply press the large button.

# General Info
Allows users of Banner Web to download an entire semester schedule as a .ics file. This can be imported to various calendar applications including iCal and Google Calendar. This was originally designed to work with Worcester Polytechnic Institute's (WPI) bannerweb, but has now been adapted to Miami University's BannerWeb, and may not work with others. Will save you a lot of time.
<p>To use: login to banner and then click Student Services & Financial Aid -> Registration -> Student Detail Schedule. Then press the large purple button on the top of the page.</p>
<p><b>Note: On weirdly scheduled days using the schedule from another day of the week, please refer to that day.</b></p>
Based off work by Evin Ugur and Paul Roberts.
